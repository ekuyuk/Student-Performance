Learning new things is\r\nalways a pleasure, especially if accompanied with friends.\r\nContact Information\r\nEmail: ekuyuk04@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/ekuyuk\r\nAbout the Project\r\nThis project briefly observes and analyzes what might be affecting a\r\nstudents performance. Family life, genetics, environmental cues; these\r\nall play a big role in a students success. Finding out the main factors,\r\nand potentially inspiring us students to beneficially work with such\r\nfactors, is the main goal.\r\nGoals\r\nComparing genetic factors (race, gender)\r\nAnalyzing individual factors (study session before test, lunch\r\ntype)\r\nFinding out the main factor affecting a students behavior from the\r\nfactors included in the data set.\r\nObstacles: Expected\r\nOrganizing the data, finding out the best way to correctly visualize\r\nthe patterns.\r\nColumn/row management and graphing\r\n““This is Data Science””\r\n~ Preceptor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nA Quick Glance\r\nA persons character, personality, all morph and set whilst their in\r\nschool. Their teachers, the environment they’re in, the academic\r\nfeedback they receive; all set the stones for the path they will pursue\r\nin life. In most scenarios, higher academic performance leads to higher\r\nsatisfaction in the career they pursue.\r\nUsing data from Kaggle, 4 different factors were observed.\r\nEthnicity\r\nGender\r\nParental Level of Education\r\nLunch Type\r\nThese factors were then compared with reading, writing, and math\r\nscores.\r\nOverview Of Reading Scores\r\nAs seen below, ethnic Group D has a tighter range, and denser test\r\nscores. Female students have scores higher than the male students for\r\nthis group; students with a parent holding a masters degree has the\r\nsmallest range, and an average higher than other levels of education –\r\nthis same pattern of parental level of education can be spotted in group\r\nC as well. Ethnic groups A, E, and B, can be seen having less students\r\nwith a parent holding a masters degree, and looser clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview of Math Scores\r\nCompared to reading scores, all groups of scores have higher\r\naverages. Male students seem to be dominating higher scores in most\r\ngroups, and score distrubiton seems to be equal in a few groups (such as\r\ngroup E and A).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview of Writing Scores\r\nStrongly contrasting the gender distribution for math scores, the\r\nhigher scores for writing are dominated by female students. This pattern\r\ncan be observed in every ethnic group, without pause. Similar to the\r\nother scores, students with a parent holding a masters degree have a\r\nhigher score average, and smaller range for all groups except A. Group B\r\nand C have the lowest average writing score when parental level of\r\neducation is “high school”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese plots, comparing parental level of education, alongside the\r\ngraphics under the “lunch” page, can lead to many different conclusions\r\nand inferences.\r\nSummary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In terms of gender distribution, in most\r\nparental levels of education and lunch types, female students have a\r\nlower average.\r\n\r\nThe following plots compare the statistics for each gender,\r\nby test type and lunch type.\r\n\r\nPlot 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlot 2\r\n\r\n## Plot 3\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
