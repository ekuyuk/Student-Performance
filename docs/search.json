Learning new things is\r\nalways a pleasure, especially if accompanied with friends.\r\nContact Information\r\nEmail: ekuyuk04@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/ekuyuk\r\nAbout the Project\r\nThis project briefly observes and analyzes what might be affecting a\r\nstudents performance. Family life, genetics, environmental cues; these\r\nall play a big role in a students success. Finding out the main factors,\r\nand potentially inspiring us students to beneficially work with such\r\nfactors, is the main goal.\r\nGoals\r\nComparing genetic factors (race, gender)\r\nAnalyzing individual factors (study session before test, lunch\r\ntype)\r\nFinding out the main factor affecting a students behavior from the\r\nfactors included in the data set.\r\nObstacles: Expected\r\nOrganizing the data, finding out the best way to correctly visualize\r\nthe patterns.\r\nColumn/row management and graphing\r\n““This is Data Science””\r\n~ Preceptor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nA students success and beneficial academic performance depends on\r\nvarious factors. The following data was pulled from Kaggle. Graphs were\r\nused to represent the correlation between test scores and parental level\r\nof education, lunch type, race, test preparation, and gender. Students\r\nthat were not taking a free/reduced lunch, had taken the preparation\r\ncourse, and had parents with an education level above high school were\r\nobserved to have higher scores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most parental levels of education, male students seem to be\r\nreceiving higher math scores; distribution of scores for students\r\nreceiving a standard lunch is higher.\r\nThe sample size of each level of education could change\r\ninterpretation, therefore:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nA Quick Glance\r\nA persons character, personality, all morph and set whilst their in\r\nschool. Their teachers, the environment they’re in, the academic\r\nfeedback they receive; all set the stones for the path they will pursue\r\nin life. In most scenarios, higher academic performance leads to higher\r\nsatisfaction in the career they pursue.\r\nUsing data from Kaggle, 4 different factors were observed.\r\nEthnicity\r\nGender\r\nParental Level of Education\r\nLunch Type\r\nThese factors were then compared with reading, writing, and math\r\nscores.\r\nSummary\r\nRacially/Ethnically: Groups C and D had higher averages\r\ncompared to other groups.\r\nTest Preparation Course: It was very blunt and clear that\r\nstudents who took the course recieved higher scores than students who\r\ndid not.\r\nStandard Lunch & Free and Reduced Lunch: Students\r\nrecieving a standard lunch could be seen doing better across all three\r\nsubjects, no matter the race or parental level of education.\r\nParental Level of Education: Students with parents of some\r\nhigh school education were, in most categories, recieving lower scores\r\ncompared to the rest. Students that had parents with an education level\r\nabove high school were observed to have higher scores.\r\nPossible Application\r\nTo potentially increase test scores, families and schools can aim to\r\nprovide all students with a standard lunch.\r\nLower education costs would encourage many to continue with their\r\neducation.\r\nThose that do attain certain degrees show care for education and\r\ntheir life; this reflects on their children, who also see education of\r\nequal worth, if nor more. Of course, there are many families with\r\nparents of minimal education, and children of extreme determination and\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nFurther Studies can be conducted to understand which learning method\r\nbiologically works better for each gender, which could improve the low\r\nscores of females in certain categories (this would also apply to male\r\nstudents in low-score clusters.)\r\nEducation is how the culture of a generation is set; its value needs\r\nto be comprehended by all for an ignorance-free society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
